Work with Cloud Flows Using Code

This article provides guidance on managing cloud flows within the Solutions tab of Power Automate using code. It focuses on utilizing either the Dataverse SDK for .NET or the Web API. Note that managing flows under "My Flows" is not supported through code.

Interact with Dataverse APIs

Dataverse offers two primary methods for interacting with cloud flows:
Microsoft Learn

    SDK for .NET: Recommended for .NET projects, it provides a typed object model and authentication methods.

    Web API: Suitable for any technology that supports HTTP requests.
    Microsoft Learn

For .NET projects, the SDK simplifies development by offering a structured approach. For other technologies, the Web API provides flexibility through HTTP requests.

Connecting to Dataverse
Using the SDK for .NET

Establish a connection by obtaining an IOrganizationService instance. This interface allows interaction with Dataverse.

For more information, refer to:

    Use the Organization service

    Quickstart: Execute an Organization service request (C#)

    IOrganizationService Interface

Using the Web API

Authenticate using OAuth to access the Web API endpoint. The base URL typically follows this format:


https://<your org>.<region domain>.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2

For more information, refer to:

    Use the Microsoft Dataverse Web API

    Quick Start: Web API sample (C#)

    Compose HTTP requests and handle errors

    Use OAuth authentication with Microsoft Dataverse

Workflow Table

Cloud flows are stored in the Process (Workflow) table, represented in the Web API as the workflow EntityType. Key columns include:
Microsoft Learn

    category: Indicates the type of flow (e.g., Modern Flow, Desktop flows).

    clientdata: JSON string of the flow definition and connection references.

    createdby, modifiedby, ownerid: Lookup fields for user or team associations.

    statecode: Status of the flow (e.g., Draft, Activated, Suspended).

    type: Specifies if the flow is a definition, activation, or template.

    workflowid, workflowidunique: Unique identifiers for the flow.

Note: In the Web API, lookup values are single-valued navigation properties and can be expanded to retrieve related records.
Listing Flows

To retrieve cloud flows, query the workflow table. For example, to get the first active automated, instant, or scheduled flow:
Microsoft Learn
Using the Web API

Send an HTTP GET request to:


https://<your org>.<region domain>.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/workflows?$filter=category eq 5 and statecode eq 1&$top=1

This query filters for modern flows (category eq 5) that are activated (statecode eq 1) and returns the top result.
